    ACTIVE TEMPLATE LIBRARY : [!output PROJECT_NAME] Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this [!output PROJECT_NAME] project for you to use as the starting point for
writing your Dynamic Link Library (DLL).

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your project.

    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

    This file contains the IDL definitions of the type library, the interfaces
    and co-classes defined in your project.
    This file will be processed by the MIDL compiler to generate:
        C++ interface definitions and GUID declarations ([!output SAFE_IDL_NAME].h)
        GUID definitions                                ([!output SAFE_IDL_NAME]_i.c)
        A type library                                  ([!output SAFE_IDL_NAME].tlb)
        Marshaling code                                 ([!output SAFE_IDL_NAME]_p.c and dlldata.c)

    This file contains the C++ interface definitions and GUID declarations of the
    items defined in [!output SAFE_IDL_NAME].idl. It will be regenerated by MIDL during compilation.

    This file contains the object map and the implementation of your DLL's exports.

    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.

    This module-definition file provides the linker with information about the exports
    required by your DLL. It contains exports for:
        DllGetClassObject
        DllCanUnloadNow
        DllRegisterServer
        DllUnregisterServer
        DllInstall

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named [!output PROJECT_NAME].pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file that defines resource IDs.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Proxy/stub DLL project and module definition file:

    This file is the project file for building a proxy/stub DLL if necessary.
	The IDL file in the main project must contain at least one interface and you must
	first compile the IDL file before building the proxy/stub DLL.	This process generates
	dlldata.c, [!output SAFE_IDL_NAME]_i.c and [!output SAFE_IDL_NAME]_p.c which are required
	to build the proxy/stub DLL.

    This is the filters file for the proxy/stub project. It contains information about the 
    association between the files in your project and the filters. This association is 
    used in the IDE to show grouping of files with similar extensions under a specific
    node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the "Source Files" filter).

    This module definition file provides the linker with information about the exports
    required by the proxy/stub.

Other notes:

	The COM+ 1.0 Support option builds the COM+ 1.0 library into your skeleton application,
	making COM+ 1.0 classes, objects, and functions available to you.
